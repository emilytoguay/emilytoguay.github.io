        Strengths: 

             • Communication skills.  I succeeded on distributing clear and 
               complete respective tasks and guide to my group in terms of 
               groupworks and the feedback I received were mostly follow 
               up questions.

             • Willingness to learn. Any knowledge required for a specific 
               task that I'm not familiar, I will give time and effort 
               to study harder to accomplish my tasks.

             • Persistent. Making this website proved that I'm persistent 
               upon going through trial and error since this is my first 
               html css, I exerted a lot of time to learn and understand 
               the functions I used and I'm satisfied with the result of 
               my website, this experience made me more passionate to 
               learn in IT field.

        Weaknesses: 
            
             • Lack of confidence. Most of the time when I'm given an 
               unfamiliar task, I tend to overthink first if I have 
               the ability to accomplish it with my present capabilities 
               and I'd get confused when studying the task as I doubt 
               myself if I'm in the right track along the progress.
                     
             • Easily distracted. Since we use internet in IT field, I get 
               easily tempted to surf facebook or youtube and it takes me 
               an hour to continue my work again instead of focusing on 
               the specific task which is a bad habit.

             • Lack of knowledge of particular programming languages. 
               There are many programming languages and I have only 
               learned C++ and that pressures me to study more and figure 
               out what language I am best at, the problem is I have lack 
               of knowledge of other languages.
